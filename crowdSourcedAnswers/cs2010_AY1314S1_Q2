Section 1
---------
1. ???
2. Prim's and Kruskal's - O(ELogV); BFS/DFS - O(V+E); Bellman - O(VE)
3. 1. O(V+E)
   2. O(V)
   3. O(V**2)
   4. O(V)
   5. O((V+E)LogE)
   6. O(VLogV)
4. 1. Modified Djikstra's O(ELogV)
   2. BFS O(V+E)
   3. TopoSort+DFS O(V+E)
   4. ???

Section 2
---------
1. If modified Djikstra, False; Greedy algorithm; Will go on forever. if Original Djikstra, WA; terminates.  
2. O(VE)
4. False. Make a test tree. 
5. True. Order will be different, but both algorithms will find all vertices in the particular connected component. 

Section 3
---------
3.1: Adjacency List. You can easily list all friends of a single person in O(1) lookup. 
3.2: ???
3.3.1: Vertices are the squares. Edges with other squares it can travel to from that square. Weights represent cost of travel. Max vertices = MN, Max Edges ~ 4MN. Graph problem to solve is SSSP. I will use Modified Djikstra's

3.3.2: Full solution
	(3 mark version)
	1. Take the grid. Start constructing a graph model (adjacency List)
	2. Make an edge between every other square you can visit, with a weight of 3. 
	3. Run djikstra and you will get 3 marks.

	4. Attempt at the rest: 
		a. Add an extra parameter to the entry in PQ that says which direction you are facing when you made the move. When adding distances, Djikstra takes into account this direction, and which diretion it moves. 
(is this algorthm fool proof?)
